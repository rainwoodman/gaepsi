Visualization and analysis toolkit for SPH cosmology code GADGET.

This is barely maintained; since I no longer work with legacy gadget format.

My latest version of Gadget, MP-Gadget switched to an easier format, bigfile:

Consult the following replacements:

- For analysing nbody simulations and 2-point statistics:

https://github.com/bccp/nbodykit

- The core visualization code in gaepsi has been simplified and stripped to gaepsi2.

When gaepsi2 is sufficiently finished, it will be renamed to gaepsi. The currently main
missing feature is the support to legacy Gadget file format, 
and OctTree prunning of a scene (which turns out to be not very important in terms of speed up),
documentation, and a revisit to the ugly C API.

- The cosmology calculation can be done with astropy.cosmology, which is distributed
by anaconda.
